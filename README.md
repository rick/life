## Day Plans

These are a set of day templates designed to help me allocate my time to health-building practices that require a frequent and regular commitment to accomplish.  The specific activities I am making time for are:  meditation, yoga, rock climbing, and saramdan (a presumably mis-transliterated Hindi or Sanskrit term we picked up in Uttarakhand, it is essentially a regular, joint volunteer effort to make ones place of living better, typically involving outdoor manual labor).

I notice that I tend to have varying pressures on my time, and these pressures result in me considering the different "types" of day I might be able to plan with.  So I've broken up the day plans into 5 distinct day types (<a href="http://github.com/rick/life/raw/master/day-plans/day-plans.png">click for image</a>):

 * *A* - A normal day, where rock climbing is the featured morning activity.  Rock climbing is chosen for its physical benefits, for its benefits as a new practice to learn, and for the meditational benefits from directly engaging with my fear of heights.
 * *B* - A normal day, where saramdan is the featured morning activity.
 * *C* - A mini-retreat meditation day, where 4 hours of morning meditation is the goal.  Longer meditation days are possible.  The concerns to be met here are that meals, yoga, and perhaps light exercise, need to happen during the day (with meals not occurring prior to yoga).  Planning for multi-day meditation retreats is beyond the scope of this set of plans.
 * *D* - A day away from home traveling.  Typically I can arise in the morning and get some amount of meditation and yoga in.  After that, typically all bets are off, and getting any meditation later in the day (except something immediately prior to bed) is usually difficult.  The priority while travelling is to find space for a second daily meditation however possible, and to find space to normalize the travel days so that they can conform to *A* or *B* as soon and as often as possible.  Note that plane flights can often be used for 1 or more hours of meditation.
 * *E* - Recovery day.  For whatever reason (typically social activities the previous night), an early morning schedule did not happen.  Prioritize meditation and yoga, with a shower to kick-start things.  The goal is to minimize the number of these events, as they exclude rock climbing and saramdan.  Too many of these days occurring is a sign of a bad trend.

"Use no screens" means that during that period of time my goal is to use no lighted screens (laptop screens, computer monitors, television screens, smartphone screens, ipad screends, etc.).  One of the main goals is to diminish my exposure to the sort of artificial light those screens produce (to that end I typically adjust household lighting at that time as well).  Positive side effects include not being immersed in the sorts of interactive distractions those screens bring, getting to sleep easier, reading more, and being more likely to socially interact with people around me in the evenings.

Note that meals are not specifically delimited on the day plans.  Typically only breakfast is a consideration for planning, as it should not occur too late, but should not precede yoga.  On a saramdan morning it is expected that a small snack would happen right before saramdan.

Currently a regular week at home would adhere to the following schedule:

 * Monday: *A*
 * Tuesday: *B*
 * Wednesday: *A*
 * Thursday: *B*
 * Friday: *A*
 * Saturday: *B* or *C*
 * Sunday: *B* or *C*

A maximum of one day on the weekend would be a *C* (mini-retreat) day.  Such a week gives 3 rock-climbing days, on those days when the gym is least likely to be crowded; as well as 3-4 days of saramdan (3 when I am having a mini-retreat, 4 otherwise).  Again, weeks with longer retreats would use custom planning.
